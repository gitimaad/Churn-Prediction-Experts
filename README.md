📈 Stock Market Analysis: Trends, Volatility, and Insights
Welcome to the Stock Market Analysis repository! This project focuses on analyzing the historical stock data of top companies, uncovering trends, and visualizing key metrics to provide actionable insights. Using Python, MySQL, and advanced visualization libraries, we explore stock price movements, technical indicators, and market behavior.

🚀 Project Overview
The goal of this project is to analyze the historical stock data of 10 major companies and derive meaningful insights into their performance. Key tasks include:

Fetching historical stock data using Yahoo Finance API.

Cleaning and processing the data to calculate technical indicators like Moving Averages, RSI, and Support/Resistance Levels.

Visualizing stock trends, volatility, and volume-price correlations.

Storing the processed data in a MySQL database for further analysis.

Creating interactive visualizations using Plotly and Seaborn.

🛠️ Tools and Technologies
Python: For data fetching, cleaning, processing, and analysis.

Libraries: yfinance, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, plotly, sqlalchemy, mysql.connector.

MySQL: For storing and querying the processed stock data.

Plotly: For creating interactive candlestick charts and visualizations.

Seaborn/Matplotlib: For static visualizations like histograms and scatter plots.

Power BI (Optional): For creating dashboards and advanced visualizations (can be integrated later).

📊 Key Insights
Stock Price Trends:

Analyzed the closing prices of stocks over time.

Calculated 50-day and 200-day Simple Moving Averages (SMA) to identify short-term and long-term trends.

Volatility Analysis:

Visualized daily returns using histograms to understand stock volatility.

Identified patterns in price fluctuations.

Technical Indicators:

Calculated Relative Strength Index (RSI) to assess overbought or oversold conditions.

Plotted Support and Resistance Levels to identify key price points.

Volume-Price Correlation:

Analyzed the relationship between trading volume and price changes.

Computed correlation coefficients to measure the strength of the relationship.

Candlestick Charts:

Created interactive candlestick charts with support/resistance levels and breakout/breakdown markers.

📈 Visualizations
Stock Price Trends:

Line charts showing closing prices along with 50-day and 200-day SMAs.

Candlestick Charts:

Interactive charts with support/resistance levels, breakouts, and breakdowns.

Volume-Price Correlation:

Scatter plots to visualize the relationship between trading volume and price changes.

Daily Return Distribution:

Histograms with KDE (Kernel Density Estimation) to analyze stock volatility.

🚀 How to Use
Step 1: Set Up the Environment
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Stock-Market-Analysis.git
Install the required Python libraries:

bash
Copy
pip install -r requirements.txt
Set up a MySQL database named stock_data and update the connection details in the script.

Step 2: Run the Script
Execute the Python script:

bash
Copy
python script.py
The script will:

Fetch historical stock data from Yahoo Finance.

Process the data and calculate technical indicators.

Save the processed data into the MySQL database.

Generate visualizations and save them as images or interactive plots.

Step 3: Explore the Data
Use the generated CSV file (merged_stock_data.csv) or query the MySQL database for further analysis.

Integrate the data with Power BI or Tableau for advanced dashboards.

📂 Data Sources
Yahoo Finance: Historical stock data for the selected companies.

MySQL Database: Processed data stored for querying and analysis.

🧠 Key Features
Automated Data Fetching:

Fetches historical stock data for multiple companies in one go.

Advanced Technical Analysis:

Calculates moving averages, RSI, and support/resistance levels.

Interactive Visualizations:

Uses Plotly for interactive candlestick charts.

Database Integration:

Stores processed data in MySQL for easy access and querying.

🎨 Creative Additions
Breakout and Breakdown Detection:

Added markers in candlestick charts to highlight breakouts (price above resistance) and breakdowns (price below support).

Volume-Price Correlation:

Introduced scatter plots to analyze the relationship between trading volume and price changes.

Merged CSV for Dashboarding:

Combined all stock data into a single CSV file for easy integration with Power BI or Tableau.
